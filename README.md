# Raspberry-pi-3B-autoconnect-accesspoint
It is my old project at June 2018

<h2>Main Idea</h2>
The main idea is to automatically connect the main raspy to known Access Point (another raspy), even when the main raspy is moving.
It connects aproximately 2-3 seconds when the AP is detected by the main raspy.
<ul>
<li>I use a raspy as a sensor on motorcycle and a raspy as Access Point on an infrastructure.</li>
<li>When the AP is not detected by main raspy, it will search the AP</li>
<li>When the AP is detected by main raspy, it will connect to the AP <strong>As Soon As Possible</strong></li>
<li>It is more fast than the default autoconnect</li>
</ul>
